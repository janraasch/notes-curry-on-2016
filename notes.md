# Curry On

## Rome! 2016

> Academia and industry need to have a talk.

> Or rather, they just need to talk in general.

Notes:
2 Min Chill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2Ulgu7HahI

Conference Website: http://www.curry-on.org/2016/

Recorded Talks: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-WICcSW1k3HsScuXxDrp0w

I prepared 6 slides each for one particularly interesting talk.

Then I will recommend and go over a list of even more talks.

And then there are still more talks on the website.

In the end we will decide, if we have a part 2 of this or if we continue in some other format or not continue at all: *Power to the people!*

## How To Win Big With Old Ideas

- Lisp `=>` REPL
- Trees `=>` immutability at low costs for all
- Datalog `=>` flexible modeling but with relational queries
- Regular Expressions `=>` declarative contracts, property-based tests, docs

<br>

### Eco-System

- figwheel `=>` live-coding
- parinfer `=>` parenthesis completion
- re-natal `=>` iOS development

Show off REPL/ClojureScript with [Mancy](http://mancy-re.pl/)

Clojure is successful:

- Symbiotic language: Java, JavaScript
- »Go with the flow»
- Simple features which can be communicated easily

> The onboard diagnostic system designed for the Boeing 737 MAX checks and reports on over 6,000 faults, giving airplane technicians and maintenance crew a critical window to the health and performance of the aircraft.

Quote from http://clojurewest.org/speakers#ddolby as mentioned by Matthias Felleisen.

Language unites other languages like English combines different topics

How does English do it? Context?!

In every Verizon switch

### Exercises in Programming Style

> How to divide the problem and put it back together

## *ex. 1* - [Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/master/03-monolith/tf-03.py)  - [Style](https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/tree/master/03-monolith)
## *ex. 2* - [Code](https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/blob/master/04-cookbook/tf-04.py)  - [Style](https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/tree/master/04-cookbook)
## *ex. 3* - [Code](https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/blob/master/05-pipeline/tf-05.py) - [Style](https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style/tree/master/05-pipeline)

- 3,4-years undergrads' code really bad/ugly
- What do we teach?
- Inspired by Raymond Queneau's »Exercises in Style«
- The same story in 99 versions
- Her story: Count occurences of words in a file
- In 33 versions
- Constraints lead to style: »Cannot load the whole file into memory. Hence write a loop.«
- Teach about »styles« <=> »constraints« relation (y, y not, etc.)
- Matthias Felleisen mentions research: CEOs say programmers which suffered through the most paradigm shifts are the best

### What is programming

[...](https://github.com/joaomilho/what-is-programming-curry-on#dining-philosophers)

> It appears that there is no consensus on what programming is about. It seems reasonable to be so, after all it is an activity that exist for a relatively short period of time.

> In this time, it changed the way we perform almost all of our other activities and it carries no smaller promises than virtual worlds and AI.

Notes:
Read »Dining philosophers« out loud.

»Worse is better« by Richard P. Gabriel, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better

[...] there is a point where less functionality ("worse") is a preferable option ("better") in terms of practicality and usability. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.

Ed Catmull: The Hungry Beast and the Ugly Baby, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LafDex0L7FM
